# 🏥 Healthcare Data Engineering Project

An end-to-end data engineering pipeline for processing, transforming, and analyzing healthcare insurance data. Built using Apache Spark, Apache Iceberg, PostgreSQL, Apache Airflow, and Apache Superset — fully containerized with Docker Compose.


This project builds a modular data engineering workflow using Docker Compose, integrating:

- 🧪 **Apache Spark + Iceberg + Jupyter Lab** – for data transformation
- 📊 **Apache Superset** – for BI dashboards and visual analytics
- ⏰ **Apache Airflow** – for scheduling weekly ETL jobs
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** – for storing gold-layer data
- 🧠 **Redis** – for Airflow's broker backend
